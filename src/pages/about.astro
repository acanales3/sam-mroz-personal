          As a communication and media major with a double minor in business
          analytics and journalism, my deep interest in media has led me to
          multiple student organizations, internships, and the opportunity to
          meet like-minded professionals with a deep interest in the art of
          storytelling.

          Across this site, I welcome all to look through my work, to understand
          my background, and most of all, to connect.

          Also, this picture may not show it, but I'm much more energetic in
          person. Although I do like that cardigan I picked out.
